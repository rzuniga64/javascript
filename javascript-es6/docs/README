ES6 currently isn't supported by all Browser. And nowhere close to all Features are implemented. But you can still use
it today, if you're using a Transpiler (transpiles ES6 to ES5) and Module Loader (loads your ES6 Modules).

Popular Transpilers are Babel and Traceur:

Babel: https://babeljs.io/
Traceur: https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler

A good module loader would be SystemJS: https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs

The general Setup doesn't differ from the one shown in Plunker!
