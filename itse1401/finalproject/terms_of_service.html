<strong>Notice Requirements.</strong>
To be sure we are able to address your claim, you must include the following information in your notice:
<ol class="mtm">
<li>
<strong>Your physical or electronic signature.</strong>
The notice should be signed either by the copyright owner of the infringing work or by someone authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf;
</li>
<li>
<strong>Identification of the copyrighted work you claim was infringed.</strong>
If multiple copyrighted works are covered by the same notification, you may provide a representative list of the infringed works.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Identification of where on our website the copyrighted material can be found.</strong>
Please provide a complete URL and any additional information necessary to enable us to locate and identify the claimed infringing material.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Your contact information.</strong>
Please provide an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address at which we can contact the complaining party.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Certification of Infringement.</strong>
The notice must certify that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material on our website is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Certification of Accuracy.</strong>
The notice must also state that the information supplied is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
<p>If you fail to comply substantially with these notice requirements you may experience delay while we seek supplemental information. In the event we are unable to obtain supplemental information that substantially complies with these requirements we may deny your request to remove or disable the material.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Takedown Upon Notice.</strong>
Upon receipt of proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, we will respond promptly to remove, or disable access to, the material.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Counter Notification.</strong>
After disabling or removing the alleged infringing material, we will take reasonable steps promptly to notify the user who posted the material that the material was removed or access was disabled. Thereafter, the user may provide a counter notification. To submit a proper counter notification a user must provide:
<ol>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of the user providing the counter notification.</li>
<li>Identification of the material that was removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access was disabled.</li>
<li>A statement by the user that "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."</li>
<li>The user's full name, address, telephone number, and user name.</li>
<li>If the user's address is located within the United States, the following statement: "I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court in which my address is located and I will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person."</li>
<li>If the user's address is not located within the United States, the following statement: "I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for any judicial district in which Peet’s Coffee and Tea may be found and I will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person."</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Actions Upon Counter Notification.</strong>
Upon receipt of a counter notification of the type described above we will promptly provide the person who gave the original notice of infringement a copy of the counter notification. We will also inform the original claimant that we will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to the material unless we receive notice, no more than 10 business days thereafter, that the claimant has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Repeat Infringers.</strong>
Posting infringing materials is a violation of our website's terms and conditions. We will not permit repeated violations of this policy. In appropriate circumstances, we may terminate any user account, disable the user’s password, or take other appropriate action with respect to any user or users if we make a reasonable determination that the user or users are repeat infringers.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Misrepresentations.</strong>
The DMCA, 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), provides for penalties against persons who knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing or that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification. If you have questions about any notification or counter notification to be provided hereunder, please seek advice from knowledgeable counsel.
