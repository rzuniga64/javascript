<p><br>

</p><br>
<p class="strong">How We Share Your Information</p>
<p>We may share personal information with trusted parties, such as service providers who assist us in our business and who are only

<ul class="disc" style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
<li>Our subsidiaries and affiliates;</li>

<li>In the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="strong">Your Choices</p>
<p>We offer you certain choices about the information we collect, how we use and share information, and how we communicate with you.

<li>Cookies. Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. However, rejecting cookies may affect your user experience, and you may not be able to access or use certain features of our sites. In addition, disabling cookies may invalidate opt outs that rely on cookies, such as web analytics or targeted advertising opt outs.</li>
<li>Targeted advertising. If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information.

to delete all of your information for technical reasons. For example, we may store personal information in long-term archives or backups or retain an identifier
to honor your opt out choices. We will continue to send you service-related communications, and we may need to keep the information we have collected about you
for record keeping, analysis, or other reasons, to the extent permitted by law.</p><br>
