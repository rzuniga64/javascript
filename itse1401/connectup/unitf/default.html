		<p>
			You don't separate your personal life from your professional life, so why 
			should your networking site? ConnectUp helps you extend and combine your social 
			and professional networks. Other sites may allow you to make professional 
			contacts or stay in touch with your friends. But only ConnectUp mixes it up by 
			helping you socialize with your business colleagues and network with your 
			friends. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Strengthening your connections is the key to a happy life and a healthy 
			career. By joining ConnectUp and inviting your contacts to do the same, you can 
			socialize your way to success.
